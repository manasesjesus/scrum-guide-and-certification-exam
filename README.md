### [Study guide](study-guide.md)

The Scrum Guide contains the definition of Scrum. Each element of the framework serves a specific purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum.

The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable. While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies and practices.

All the information contained in the study guide has been gathered from different sources such as the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/), [Agile Glossary](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/agile-glossary/), several books, et al.

### [Certification exam](certiprof-exam.md)

The exam questions are similar to those in the certification exam and have been taken from the [study guide](study-guide.md), as well as the [example questions](https://sampleexams.certiprof.com/scrum-foundation-1-spanish) from CertiProf.
